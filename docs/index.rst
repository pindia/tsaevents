1. `Member guide <member_guide>`_ - For chapter members, detailing how to enter events and view information through the system
2. `Advisor guide <advisor_guide>`_ - For chapter advisors and officers, detailing how to view and manage the data in the system

Note: the help system is still quite incomplete. Please be patient as it is being written.
