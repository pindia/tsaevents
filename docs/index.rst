

Welcome to the TSA Events system! In these pages you can find instructions for using the system. The help system is divided into two main parts:

1. `Member guide <member_guide>`_ - For chapter members, detailing how to enter events and view information through the system
2. `Advisor guide <advisor_guide>`_ - For chapter advisors and officers, detailing how to view and manage the data in the system

Some other miscellaneous topics covered:

* `PA Qualification Rules <pa_qualification>`_ - Details some of the complexities of Pennsylvania's state qualification system

If your questions are not answered in the help pages or you need something in your chapter's system changed, contact one of your chapter advisors. Their email addresses are listed on the `contact page </contact/>`_ (you must be logged in).

If you have technical issues using the system or your chapter advisor is unable to answer you question, you may contact the site administrator at `admin@tsaevents.com <admin@tsaevents.com>`_
