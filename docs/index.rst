

Welcome to the TSA Events system! In these pages you can find instructions for using the system. The help system is divided into two main parts:

1. `Member guide <member_guide>`_ - For chapter members, detailing how to enter events and view information through the system
2. `Advisor guide <advisor_guide>`_ - For chapter advisors and officers, detailing how to view and manage the data in the system

Some other miscellaneous topics covered:

* `PA Qualification Rules <pa_qualification>`_ - Details some of the complexities of Pennsylvania's state qualification system


Note: the help system is still quite incomplete. Please be patient as it is being written.
