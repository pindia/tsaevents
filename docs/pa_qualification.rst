Pennsylvania's qualification rules can be a source of confusion. This page is intended to clear up some of the confusion surrounding the system.

Qualification-Only Events
==========================

Qualification-only events are indicated with a "Q" for their maximum on the `event list <member_guide#event-list>`_ (in State mode). To enter at States for these events, you *must* enter at Regionals and place well. How well you need to place is determined by the total number of Regional entrants:

+---------------+------------+
| # of Entrants | Qualifiers |
+===============+============+
| 0-7           | Top 3      |
+---------------+------------+
| 8-12          | Top 4      |
+---------------+------------+
| 13-17         | Top 7      |
+---------------+------------+
| 18-23         | Top 8      |
+---------------+------------+
| 24-29         | Top 10     |
+---------------+------------+
| 30-36         | Top 11     |
+---------------+------------+
| 37-42         | Top 12     |
+---------------+------------+
| 43+           | Top 13     |
+---------------+------------+

Other Events
=============

Other events are indicated with a number for their maximum on the event list. Each chapter may send that number of individuals or teams to States, regardless of how well they placed at Regionals or even if they entered at all. However, the qualification rules above may allow a chapter to *exceed* the limit, if all of the teams sent qualified within the range defined above.

For instance, if a total of nine teams enter an event with a 1/chapter qualification and two teams from one chapter get 1st and 4th place, they can both compete in States since they are both in the top 4. If, however, the second team got 5th instead, only the top team could go.
